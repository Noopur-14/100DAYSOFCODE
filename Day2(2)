Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

Note that the letters wrap around.

For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"

SOLUTION:
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = letters.length-1;
        int mid = 0;
        
                 
        while(start <= end)
        {
            mid = start + (end-start)/2;
             if(target < letters[mid])
                end = mid - 1;
            else
                start = mid + 1;
        }
        
        
        return letters[start % letters.length]
        }
}
