You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the ith customer has in the jth bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Example:
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int ans=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int r=0;r<accounts.length;r++)
        {
            int sum=0;
            for(int c=0;c<accounts[r].length;c++)
            {
                sum=sum+accounts[r][c];
            }
            if(sum>ans)
            {
                ans=sum;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
